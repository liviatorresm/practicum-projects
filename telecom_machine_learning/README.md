## Data

In this project, I used the dataframe of Telecom Plans Analysis, which has already passed the data pre-processing step.

- `сalls` — number of calls
- `minutes` — total duration of the call in minutes
- `messages` — number of text messages
- `mb_used` — Internet traffic used in MB
- `is_ultra` — plan for the current month (Ultra - 1, Smart - 0)

## Goal

This project aims to develop a model with the highest possible accuracy that can analyze customer behavior and recommend one of Megaline's latest plans: Smart or Ultra

## Libraries used:

* pandas
* scikit-learn
