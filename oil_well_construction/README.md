## Data

**Features**
    - `d` — unique oil well identifier
    - `f0, f1, f2` — three dot characteristics (their specific meaning is not important, but the characteristics themselves are significant)

**Target**
    - `product` — volume of reserves in the oil well (thousands of barrels).

## Goal

Create a linear regression model to find the best region to build a new well, based on data on oil samples from three different regions and the highest profit margin.
